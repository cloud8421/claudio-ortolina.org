# Hello!

I'm Claudio Ortolina and this is the source code for [my website](https://claudio-ortolina.org), an old-fashioned blog where I post about all sorts of topics.

# Setup

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and it uses the [Hello Friend](https://hugo-hello-friend.now.sh) theme without any customization.

You can see the currently used Hugo version [in the CI setup](https://github.com/cloud8421/claudio-ortolina.org/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml#L20).

Assuming you have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), it's just a matter of:

1. Cloning this repository
2. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to pull theme files
3. Run `hugo server` to build for development with live reload
