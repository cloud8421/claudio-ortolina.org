I recently wrote a blog post about working with large files in Elixir and OTP at [[https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2021/the-perils-of-large-files-in-elixir/][PSPDFKit's blog]].

The post originated from a talk I gave last year for [[https://www.elixirconf.eu][ElixirConf.eu]], but it contains more precise analysis.
