# Hello!

I'm Claudio Ortolina and this is my website, an old-fashioned blog where I post about whatever I want.

I currently work as a software engineer at PSPDFKit GmbH.

If you run out of TV series to binge, you can watch any of my talks at [Talks]({{< ref "/talks" >}} "Talks").

You can contact me at <cloud8421@gmail.com>.
