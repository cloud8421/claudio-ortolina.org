# Hello!

I'm Claudio Ortolina and this is my website, an old-fashioned blog where I post about all sorts of topics.

I currently work as CTO at PSPDFKit GmbH.

If you run out of TV series to binge, you can watch any of my [talks]({{< ref "/talks" >}} "Talks").

You can contact me by email at <cloud8421@gmail.com>.
